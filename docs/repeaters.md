Repeater Filetypes
==================

When using repeater fields, the get-syntax (`{{ repeaterfield.get('fieldname') }}`)
must be used. This is partly because of a bug in the Bolt core and we won't fix
it until Bolt 4.0 is released. See [issue #90](https://github.com/BoltTranslate/Translate/issues/90) for more information.
